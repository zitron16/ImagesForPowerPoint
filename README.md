Instructions for test

This test below measures your ability to create a solution based off of requirements given by a user.

 

Keys to Success for this test:

Create it in GitHub
Create a solution using C# and WPF
Have the solution pulling images from Google, not a 3rd party API
 

Directions:

Create a solution that a user can use to aid them in generating a power point slide. They want the solution to give them suggestions of images to use form the internet (Google) based on the contents of the information they are using for the slide. They want to improve efficiency and save time not having to search for images for every slide they are making for their presentations.

Create a solution that accepts user input and provides output. Utilize words in the title, and bold words in the text area to bring suggested images in, with ability to select multiple images to include in the slide

Title area (input)
Text area (input)
image suggestion area, should allow multiple image selection (output)
 

Final solution should use title, text areas, and using selected images to build power point slide.

# The solution works but some requirements were not met like automatically making a powerpoint slide. Hopefully, they see some potential and realize with training, developer can be effective.
